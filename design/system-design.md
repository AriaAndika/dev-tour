## Vertical Scaling

adding more resources to server, like ram or cpu. This approach is easy but expensive.

## Horizontal Scaling

adding replica or instance of a server. This add a fault-tolerance, because if one of the server goes down, other server can still handle the request. This approach is more complicated.

## Load Balancer

A server called reverse-proxy, that spread request evenly to other server instance.
